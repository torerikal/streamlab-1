[Streamlab](https://vimond.github.io/streamlab-2/) is a cross-technology stream test tool for the browser from [Vimond](https://vimond.com) developers.

Experiment with, verify, or troubleshoot MPEG-DASH, HLS, and CMAF streams, or progressive video files. 

Streamlab provides a consistent and convenient user interface for playing adaptive streams through [Shaka Player](https://github.com/google/shaka-player) and [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js), or directly through the browser's internal stream support in the HTML `<video>` element.

Streamlab is built upon [Replay](https://github.com/vimond/replay), a full-featured React video player component facilitating adaptive stream playback, wrapping the mentioned adaptive streaming players.

## Features

It supports live/DVR streams, DRM, subtitles, multiple audio tracks, according to the mentioned adaptive player libraries' features. All modern browsers are supported.

Streamlab is intended to bring convenience to trying out streams in the browser.

Fill in stream URLs and configure playback, and the setup will be persisted between browser sessions (and closed/reopened tabs). All playback attempts are added to a history, and earlier stream URLs and other details can be restored and retried. 

It displays context-aware messages providing information and guidance on technical stream details, and attempts to bring error details up to the surface when the stream doesn't play.
