**Is the problem actually a Streamlab bug?**

Streamlab and its player Replay facilitates stream playback with different technologies. However, for this it mainly relies on native browser features and/or third party libraries.

Bug reports that in reality appear to be requests for troubleshooting playback issues with specific streams, will mainly be rejected.

Before considering submitting a bug report, please get an understanding of whether the experienced issue is in fact a Streamlab bug, or if it is related to the stream or underlying third party player libraries.

If you are not confident Streamlab is capable of playing your stream properly, you can test it in the demo/test pages for the third party player libraries themselves:

 https://hls-js.netlify.com/demo
 http://shaka-player-demo.appspot.com/
 https://developers.canal-plus.com/rx-player/
 
If your stream also doesn't play here, refrain from submitting a Streamlab bug report.
