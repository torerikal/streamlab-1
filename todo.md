### Remember

* Accordion folds with "active" settings should be marked.
* Drawer for save/load? Reconsider what to save/load. Easy export/import. Autosave history after each stream start? And then later give names?
* Undo clear button after clear.
* Play, Clear, Save, History, Share buttons at bottom of right pane.
